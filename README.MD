Once selected, the extension will write a new tweet.

For a reply, it will generate a tweet based on the original tweet. For a new tweet, it will write a tweet based on what's trending right now.

## ⚠️ Warning
Depending on the tweet type, TweetGPT can sometimes generate controversial or even offensive tweets.
Remember, this is like an L2 autopilot - the driver is responsible for the outcome. Don't tweet what you disagree with, just re-generate the tweet instead.
